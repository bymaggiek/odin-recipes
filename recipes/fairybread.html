               <li><b>Crust On or Off</b> - It's up to you.</li>
               <li><b>Start with (Slightly) Frozen Bread</b> - This makes it much easier to spread butter or margarine over the bread as it won't rip apart. Make sure not to use bread straight from the freezer. Let it defrost slightly first.</li>
               <li><b>Play With Shapes</b> - Cut the bread into cute shapes like triangles, circles or use a cookie cutter for hearts or stars. </li>
